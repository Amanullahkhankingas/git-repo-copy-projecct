# Replit Creates Challenge 4

> "Use only emojis"

## Personal Notes

I yield it doesn't use *only* emojis, but its main focus is on emojis
and that's what counts :D. Implemented [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/)
and used its models and abstractions to calculate face expression
recognition values and determine the most likely mood. Then it outputs
that information as emojis!
